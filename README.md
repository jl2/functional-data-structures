In this project I'm implementing some of the data structures from the book 
[Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504)
 in Common Lisp.

My goal is to learn more about functional data structures, while also learning about CLOS.

So far I've created an abstract heap class and implemented a leftist heap using the heap interface.

Next I'll implement a binomial heap.
